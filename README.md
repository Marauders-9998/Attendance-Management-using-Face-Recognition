## Objective
This desktop application aims to simplify the process of Attendance Management of different classes and batches using Face Recognition and user-friendly GUI. The management of data and marking of attendance is carried out in Excel files.

## About the Project
This python based app uses OpenCV libraries: face detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifier and face recognition using Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) and openpyxl library to manage excel sheet through python scripts. GUI features are implemented using tkinter library.

## About the app
The app has two main Panels: Students' and Manager's

Students' panel has one main feature in marking the attendance

Manager's panel has various features in adding a new class, adding a student to logged-in class, training the recognizer and viewing the attendance register

Captured photo after marking attendance automatically gets added to training data images. If the app somehow fails to recognize a student, the Manager can manually mark a student's attendance in attendance register by looking at the images in unrecognized students directory.
<br/>
**Directory Structure:**
<br/>
./extras - contains the attendance register of different classes and the file containing names of all classes
<br/>
./images - contains the training data images and unrecognized student's directory
<br/>
./student's list - contains the files containing the information of all students of a class

## Usage
```bash
python Attendance_app.py
```
 - use **'Marauders'** as class-code to add classes to the software
 - browse the Manager and Student's Panel using class code of the batch you want to enter with
 - the username is **'ADMIN'** and password **'ubuntu'**
 - use `SPACE-bar` to click images wherever needed
 - you can add more images to the training data manually as well
